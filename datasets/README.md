Open data sets related to statistics of tax in Nepal are scarce. So we scraped the data from different sources and saved them in easy to use csv format. These data sets were made in the hackathon organised on Open data day 2015. They are made available here for anyone to make use of them.

**Tools used for scraping:**
- [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/): Tabula is a tool for liberating data tables locked inside PDF files.

- [Project Naptha](https://projectnaptha.com/): An OCR app to extract text from images.
