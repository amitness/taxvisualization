Open data sets related to tax are scarce. So we scraped the data from different sources and saved them in easy to use csv format for our hackathon app. They are made available here for anyone to make use of them.

Tools used for scraping:
- Tabula: http://tabula.technology/
      Tabula is a tool for liberating data tables locked inside PDF files.

- Project Naptha: https://projectnaptha.com/
-    An OCR app to extract text from images.
