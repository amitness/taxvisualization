# Tax Visualization
 This project is the representation of tax paid by different private institutions, governmental branches and the citizens. We are trying to show the statistics of taxes paid throughout the country. 
 
 The project was a wordpress powered website which visualized different statistic related to tax in Nepal. We scraped datas related to tax and saved them in csv format. The the csv were hosted on cloud in google drive and we made interactive graphs and charts using the csv. Any changes made to the spreadsheet updated the graphs as well.
